                        Like most adventure games Gone Home asks you to solve
                        puzzles in order to access later areas, but unlike most
                        of its peers, it does its best to contextualize all
                        puzzles as being part of the world, including no out of
                        place concepts like a door which requires three stone
                        dogs heads in order to open in order to keep you
                        immersed in the real world setting. Most of its puzzles
                        don’t require too much thought, requiring you mainly to
                        just search the area in order to solve them, forcing you
                        to examine everything, making you pay attention to all
                        the little details they crammed into the environment.

                        One of my favorite puzzles is where you find a map of
                        the house which includes a room that doesn’t seem to
                        exist. This leads you to further explore the neighboring
                        room on the map, which ends with you finding a secret
                        passageway to another part of the house. Even these
                        strange secret passageways are later tied into the
                        house’s history further adding to the lore. Gone Home
                        cleverly uses it’s puzzles to not just act as a gateway
                        to progress like in most other adventure games, but to
                        force you to explore it’s detailed world and have the
                        solutions add to the story and lore of the game.
