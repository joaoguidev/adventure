                    <h1>How Impactful was Gone Home?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Gone Home was one of the first meldings of walking
                        simulators and adventure games. At the time walking
                        simulators were a new genre pioneered by Dear Esther and
                        were mainly about walking from one place to another as
                        the story was told to you without much to do other than
                        follow the linear path. Adventure games were a much
                        older genre based around exploring and story sections
                        with constant breaks for non-contextual puzzles. Gone
                        Home, when deciding to combine the genres, took the best
                        parts of both and managed to create a game that would
                        revolutionize the indie game sphere and create it’s very
                        own sub-genre of story-focused adventure games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It managed to inspire many other indie games such as
                        What Remains of Edith Finch, Firewatch, and Virginia.
                        It’s excellently made house that managed to tell the
                        story of those living in it also inspired sections of
                        Uncharted 4, which contains two sections where you walk
                        through the Drake’s households and learn what they have
                        been up to since you last saw them. Gone Home was a
                        landmark game in the adventure game and Walking
                        Simulator genres and may stand the test of time as one
                        of the most influential games when it comes to
                        environmental storytelling.
