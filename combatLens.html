                        Gone Home is a very deep game if given the chance,
                        although the player could beat the game in an hour at
                        the end of it they would have missed what makes the game
                        shine, it’s hidden lore. The lore and backstories in
                        this game are easy to pass by and can be difficult to
                        discover everything on the players first try of the
                        game, from the mother thinking of another man and the
                        father being a failed writer at first look into these
                        two characters the player would never find that out.
                        However, by digging through hidden articles and finding
                        secret object around the house the player can slowly
                        piece together this lore about them, not only does this
                        make the player feel more for these two characters they
                        never meet by it ties into what we learn about them in
                        the story and how their personality affects the ones
                        around them, without these hidden lore/secrets the games
                        story might seem dull or not very detailed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not all the lore is easy for the player to discover some
                        things like the father’s connection to the mansions
                        previous owner is completely missed if the player
                        doesn’t take their time and try hard at this game, each
                        secret can quickly change how the player feels from
                        happy to suddenly shocked and sad, at the end the player
                        might be anxious to go to the attic scared of what they
                        will find while also be worried about the father and the
                        financial standing of the family. The secrets in Gone
                        Home are very detailed and a definite plus for this game
                        although the storyline about Sam and where everyone is,
                        is important. The secrets are what flesh out this game
                        and give it a deeper connection to the player as they
                        explore the old mansion.
