                        The whole game is based around exploring your family’s
                        new house in order to discover how they’re lives have
                        changed. For example, through the mess of papers on your
                        father’s desk that all have to do with his next book and
                        you can tell how overwhelmed he is by it. You can find
                        tons of crumpled pieces of paper in the trash of failed
                        ideas he’s had, showing that he might be suffering from
                        writer’s block. You see on his bulletin board that along
                        with all his other ideas he wrote in big bold letters
                        “you can do better.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the letters you find hidden in his cabinets you
                        find out that his last and second book didn’t do so well
                        and that his next book is being seen as his last chance
                        to prove himself to his publishers. You later find a
                        different letter from his father explaining how
                        disappointed he is in the first book he wrote saying
                        that “you can do better.” This helps to explain the
                        failure of the second book as his publisher complains
                        that it was overwritten and that he needs to pace
                        himself, showing that he might have burnt himself out in
                        order to impress his father. Later on you can find a
                        pamphlet for a marriage counselor in his room which can
                        indicate that his work has pushed him and his wife away
                        from each other.

                        All of these little environmental details add up to a
                        surprisingly vivid portrait of a tortured author who’s
                        pushed himself too hard and now feels like he’s failed
                        at everything, isolating those he most cares out of what
                        might be shame, but undoubtedly also to keep trying to
                        impress his father, but feels unable to do what everyone
                        is depending on him for because of his writer’s block.
                        It’s startling how much depth this game can give to its
                        main characters without ever letting you meet them and
                        it does it all by letting you explore and discover all
                        this for yourself, letting you put the pieces together
                        on your own, making it feel even more satisfying when
                        you find everything and feel like you really understand
                        everyone in this house.
