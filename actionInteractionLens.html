                        Gone home is a perfect game when it comes to exciting
                        the player's curiosity. The game starts off by having
                        the player come home to find that none of their family
                        members are home. So the player is instantly off the bat
                        intrigued to look around the house for clues to see
                        where their family is. This isn't all though. That game
                        is built in the mind of exploration. So every drawer and
                        cupboard and so on can be opened and explored for clues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is terrific because as the player keeps opening
                        drawers and such and finding more clues the more they
                        learn about their missing family and some past history
                        intriguing them to keep exploring or as some would
                        consider snoop. The player gets clues and answers to any
                        previous questions they might have had. What keeps the
                        player motivated to keep exploring that even though
                        every piece of evidence answers a previous question it
                        also sparks up new and more interesting questions. You
                        start the game wondering where your family is and you
                        end up asking more questions than you would have ever
                        expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It feels enjoyable to undiscover these clues because you
                        get to learn about the tragic history all your family
                        members have gone through or are going through. This
                        game is very lore-heavy so the more you discover the
                        more interesting the story gets. The gameplay on average
                        is only about 4 hours so in one short burst, most people
                        will play this game in one playthrough because it's like
                        reading a book that you can interact with. It rewards
                        the player with heavy lore as they keep discovering
                        clues as they go. This game made walking sims actually
                        enjoyable.
