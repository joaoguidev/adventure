                        What surprised me at first when I was introduced to this game was the amount of freedom you had to explore. To me, walking simulators were just another way to tell a cool unique story but I think it was the lens of surprise that made this game different from other walking sims. Not only this but as I got to adventure around the story had a nice twist in the story and I would never have seen it coming. The story is never predictable because every time you think you know what's coming next there's another twist and this is another reason why as the player you feel intrigued to learn more. I think a way they have had more surprises was to add some more puzzles to solve but then it would be less of a walking genre and I am not sure if that is what the developers had in mind.

                        The embedded clues that are within objects is what makes this game special. As a player, you can go to a bookshelf and pick up a book and find a page written clue or any clue in this game. Each clue isn't a simple key to find more clues but a key that unlocks more lore in the story which keeps you super interested to keep learning more. In the end, you learn about so much family drama and secrets that you just need to know how it all ended where you are standing.
