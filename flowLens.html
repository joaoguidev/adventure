                        The game is a case study on how to develop a non-linear,
                        narrative-driven game. To begin with, the game world is
                        basically a mansion, to the likes of Resident Evil 1
                        kind of mansion. What makes sense of it and turns it
                        into something special is the story behind it. From the
                        get-go, the exploration and discovery are very evident
                        because the protagonist is faced with an emptied mansion
                        and the lens of curiosity comes right afterward with the
                        sensation of “what happened here, where is everybody,
                        why the house is empty?”. The story from the very
                        beginning is filled with twists and turns and offers an
                        ample stage for the characters involved to hold their
                        own share of secrets (lens of secret), and shortcomings
                        that it is up to the player exploration to find out more
                        about than.

                        The game gets close to the adventure games from the ’90s
                        regarding the idea of solving puzzles in order to access
                        new pieces of the world. What is different therefore is
                        that the puzzles here are not purely non-contextual but
                        actually are much more tied together with the story and
                        lore of the game if compared with the older games of the
                        same genre. The rebirth of this genre in the mid-2000s
                        pointed in the direction of fusing the game and
                        narrative better but I cannot think of any game that
                        carried the narrative to the depths that Gone home did.
                        It is a narrative that shines a spotlight on themes like
                        sexuality, friendship, and family immersed game world of
                        suspense and mystery.
